# CIS543 Final-Project

## Twitter API

In this group project, my teammates and I collected the data from Twitetr directly using Twitter API. We collected over 119,000 tweets in a week. A text analysis was performed to see what words were used the most in all the tweets collected as well as to see how many of them used hashtags and mentioned any other account.
